/**
 * The model a run is *given*, which is a different question from the model a
 * hub has stored and from the model it reports.
 *
 * `effectiveModel` reads a stored setting as a preference among what is still
 * offered, so retiring a model moves the homes that had chosen it. Every
 * surface that *reports* which model answered went through it — `GET
 * /settings/ai`, `ai_runs.modelId`, `status.lastRun.model`, the backoff gate's
 * credential id — and the one place that picks the model to actually *run*
 * did not, which is the only place where being wrong costs anything. So a hub
 * set to a retired model kept running it while every screen and every recorded
 * row said otherwise: silently, because `isSupportedModel` is deliberately the
 * broad price-table allowlist (a stored setting must never start 400-ing) and
 * let it straight through.
